# INET4031 - Module 6 - Working with Remote Systems


This project is a simple webpage that uses HTML and JavaScript to turn a lightbulb image on and off with buttons.  
It was created to demonstrate how browsers render `.html` files locally and how JavaScript adds interactivity.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Click the **ON** or **OFF** buttons to control the lightbulb.

## Files
- `index.html` – main webpage structure and script
- `light_on.png` / `light_off.png` – images used for the lightbulb
